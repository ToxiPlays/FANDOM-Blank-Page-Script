<h1>Welcome</h1>
This is a script that adds a button to every FANDOM article that allows you to "blank" the page. This means it will delete everything from the article. This script can be used for actions such as deleting vandalisim, or clearing a sandbox.
<h2>Installing</h2>
To add this script, copy the code from <code>code.js</code> in the #release branch to your personal FANDOM JS. Do not use the #dev branch, unless you are debugging an old release.
